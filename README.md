## Description
The FibonacciSequenceTwo program is a recursive Java application that calculates the Fibonacci sequence for a given integer input. If the input is negative, the program returns -1 to indicate invalid input. The program outputs the Fibonacci number corresponding to the input value, calculated using the classic recursive approach.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/FibonacciSequenceTwo.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd FibonacciSequenceTwo 
```
- Compile the FibonacciSequenceTwo.java file: 
```Java
- javac FibonacciSequenceTwo.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java FibonacciSequenceTwo
```

## Application Usage
The program expects a single integer input, which represents the position in the Fibonacci sequence you want to calculate. The program will output the Fibonacci number at that position. If the input is negative, the program returns -1.  Example:

```Java
Input: 7 
```
```Java
Output: fibonacci(7) is 13 
```
- For an input of 7, the output will be 13 because the 7th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 13.  

For a negative input, such as -3, the output will always be -1:  
```Java
Input: -3 
```
```Java
Output: fibonacci(-3) is -1
```

## Test Commands
To test the program, provide various inputs to calculate different Fibonacci numbers and check how the program handles both valid and negative inputs.
